= Multi Column Search Plugin

# Currently requires Rails 3 Active Record or above

v 0.0.2
 

Quick and dirty multi column LIKE searches. Need to search accross multiple columns, like company(name, address, city, state, zip)

Running lots of queries or have a large data set? You should probably upgrade to a real search back-end already!

== Install as plugin

  rails plugin install git://github.com/jackhq/multi_column_search.git

== Examples

Add a search method to your model by calling multi_column_search with the fields you want to search.

  class Company
    multi_column_search :name, :address, :city, :state, :zip
  end
 
Search for a single or multi value across all searched columns.

  Company.search('Sam Comp')             # => any company with name, address, city, state, zip containing with Sam Comp
  
== Install

Rails 3 Gem

   # add to your gemfile in bundler
   bundle install
